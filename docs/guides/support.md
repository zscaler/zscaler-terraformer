# General Support Statement

The Zscaler Terraformer Tool is supported and maintained by the Zscaler Technology Alliances team, and we welcome questions on how to use the tool.
Please, refer to our [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) for guidance on typical problems.

All bug reports and feature requests must be submitted via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-terraformer/issues). When reporting bugs, please include a detailed description that demonstrates the bug and the command output. Stack traces will also be helpful.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**:: Please ensure any sensitive information is redacted as Issues and Pull Requests are publicly viewable.

Notice that we will **NOT**, however, fix bugs upon customer demand, as we have to prioritize all pending bugs and features, as part of the product's backlog and release cycles.

## Support Ticket Severity

Support tickets related to the Zscaler Terraformer tool can be opened with [Zscaler Support](https://help.zscaler.com/login-tickets), however since the tool is just a client of the underlying product API, we will **NOT** be able to treat related support requests as a Severity-1 (Immediate time frame).

Urgent, production related issues associated with this tool can be resolved via direct interaction with the underlying API or UI. We will ask customers to resort to these methods to resolve downtime or urgent issues. If you have an urgent escalation, please contact your local Zscaler account team (RSM/SE/CSM/TAM) for assistance.
